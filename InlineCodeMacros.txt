I had an idea to creat a macro laguage that you could embed inside source code for other launguages.

The language would generate source code.

For example, if you embedded the code inside C# you could generate a for loop around an array:

// loop myarray { Console.WriteLine("[{0}] {1}", i, myarray[i]); }

would generate the code:
for(int i = 0; i < myarray.Length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine("[{0}] {1}", i, myarray[i]);
}
